Problem 1-2

Show that it is possible to buy exactly 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55 McNuggets, 
by finding solutions to the Diophantine equation. list the combinations of 
6, 9 and 20 packs of McNuggets you need to buy in order to get each of the 
exact amounts.Given that it is possible to buy sets of 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 
or 55 McNuggets by combinations of 6, 9 and 20 packs, show that it is possible
 to buy 56, 57,â€¦, 65 McNuggets. In other words, show how, given solutions 
 for 50-55, one can derive solutions for 56-65.
 
Problem 3

Write an iterative program that finds the largest number of McNuggets that
cannot be bought in exact quantity.
